            So, we are basically having rowOffsets from (-n+1) to (n-1). Why ? Read all the comments to know
            For example : n = 2
            rowOff will have values -1, 0, 1
            colOff will have values -1, 0, 1
            
            Based on this rowOff,colOff, we will move B over A starting from "bottom left"
            1) rowOff  = -1, colOff = -1, means B is at bottom left overlapping with A[row][col] and B[row+rowOff][col+colOff]
            i.e. A[row][col] = A[1][1]
            i.e. B[row+rowOff][col+colOff] = B[0][0]
            
            2) For rowOff = -1 , we will have colOff -1, 0, 1 which means we are moving the window B towards right till we cross boundary
            
            Similarly we move ahead with rowOff  = 0, and then 1.....
